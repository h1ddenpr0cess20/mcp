# Upstream Data Providers

The FastMCP integrations are thin wrappers around RapidAPI hosts. Every tool in
this repository talks to exactly one of the subscriptions listed below. Make
sure your RapidAPI account is subscribed before turning on a domain server, or
the requests will fail with authentication errors.

## Operational Checklist

1. Verify `RAPIDAPI_KEY` has access to every subscription you intend to use.
2. Subscribe to free tiers during development; upgrade before production loads.
3. Track rate limitsâ€”every API above enforces its own quotas. The wrappers do
   not retry automatically.

> Tip: capture the subscription tier and known limits in your team wiki if you
> expect heavy traffic so future operators do not have to rediscover them.
